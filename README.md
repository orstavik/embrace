Template engine 

```js
//todo 0: class for the Def. Call it StampType.
//todo 1: DDRender. The extractUnusedInnerReusables(Def) is untested!!
//        make a test for the extractUnusedInnerReusables(Def). This will require reuse of common template ids.
//        this is actually a little tricky. We can reuse the same dom if the insides of the templates are identical, 
//        regardless of the if and for. This means that we actually would like the start and end nodes not be part of the same system.
//todo 2: fix the getInstance function so it is also a Stamp. That way we can hide #nodes and #start in the Stamp.
